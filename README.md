### Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting future sales for a chain of retail stores using time-series forecasting techniques. We employ the Facebook Prophet model to handle the complex seasonality and holiday effects in the sales data. The goal is to provide accurate sales forecasts that can help in inventory management, staffing, and other operational decisions.

### Dataset
We use two primary datasets:
1. **Sales Training Data**: Contains daily sales data for individual stores, along with information on promotions, holidays, and store openings.
2. **Store Information Data**: Provides details about each store, such as store type, assortment type, competition distance, and promotional periods.

The datasets are sourced from the [Kaggle Rossmann Store Sales competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data).

### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning and merging the datasets to create a unified dataset for analysis and modeling. Key steps include:
- Handling missing values.
- Filtering out days when stores are closed.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Creating new features such as year, month, and day from the date column.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps in understanding the underlying patterns in the data. Key insights include:
- Distribution of sales and customer counts.
- Impact of promotions on sales.
- Seasonal trends and holiday effects.
- Correlation between different features and sales.

### Modeling with Facebook Prophet
Facebook Prophet is a powerful tool for time-series forecasting. It automatically detects seasonality, trends, and holidays. The modeling process involves:
- Formatting the data for Prophet.
- Defining holidays and special events.
- Training the Prophet model on the historical sales data.
- Generating future sales forecasts for specific stores.

### Results
The results include visualizations of the forecasted sales along with components like trend, weekly seasonality, and holidays. The forecasts help in identifying peak sales periods and the impact of various factors on sales.

### Conclusion
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of Facebook Prophet in forecasting retail sales. Accurate forecasts can significantly enhance decision-making in retail operations, leading to better inventory management, staffing, and promotional planning.

### How to Run the Project
1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have all necessary Python libraries installed, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and `fbprophet`.
2. **Download Data**: Obtain the datasets from the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data).
3. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the Jupyter notebook or Python script that preprocesses the data, performs EDA, and trains the Prophet model.

### Future Work
- **Model Improvement**: Incorporate additional features such as weather data, economic indicators, and more granular promotional details.
- **Deployment**: Develop a web application to visualize forecasts interactively.
- **Multi-Store Forecasting**: Extend the model to forecast sales for multiple stores simultaneously, considering their interactions.
